# High Dimensionality

## High Dimensionality
* represent a vector with a magnitude and a unit vector
* compute the L1 and L2 distances between a pair of vectors
* explain the decreasing value of RMSE as dimensions increase
* compute RMSE between pairs of vectors and select the pair with the smallest

## Dimensionality Reduction
* graph the top two principal components of a high dimensional data set using PCA
* compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a nonsingular matrix
* add kI to a singular matrix to make it nonsingular
* write a singular value decomposition of 1000 points in $R^15$ in python

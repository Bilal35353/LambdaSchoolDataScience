# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Learning Objectives

### Data Structures
* List the main BigO runtime complexities of common data structure operations
* Understand and enumerate some of the pros and cons of linked lists, queues, binary search trees, and heaps

### Algorithms Overview
* Understand/interpret BigO, and relate it to why we care about algorithmic efficiency in general
* List and describe major algorithmic approaches
* Approach novel problems with an algorithmic mindset
* Relate algorithms to the data structures that underlie/enable them
* Make practical "real-world" development decisions, appropriately informed by algorithms

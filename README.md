# Lambda School Data Science with Machine Learning

My solutions to the assignments and coding challenges from the [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/) Data Science Major.

### Environment

The majority of the work is done using IPython notebooks run in Google's [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) environment. No dependencies need to be installed on a local machine to save and work with these notebooks in Google Drive.

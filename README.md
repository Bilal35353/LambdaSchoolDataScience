# Lambda School Data Science with Machine Learning

My solutions to the assignments and coding challenges from the [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/) Data Science Major.

### Environment

The majority of the work is done using IPython notebooks run in Google's [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) environment. No dependencies need to be installed on a local machine to save and work with these notebooks in Google Drive.

GitHub's rendering of notebooks does not include animations rendered in the notebook outputs as JavaScript widgets. To view these, use `nbviewer`.

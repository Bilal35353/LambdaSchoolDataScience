# Probability and Statistics

## External Content

In the Sprint Challenge, there was a challenge to apply the analytical tools to a new dataset and publish the findings. To facilitate this, I began working on a small python module to make the workflow more reproducible.

## Learning Objectives

### Quantitative Data Analysis
* Compute summary statistics (e.g. Mean, Median, Standard Deviation, Variance)
* Construct contingency tables and use them to compute conditional probabilities

### Graphical Data Analysis
* Visualize distributions through Empirical Cumulative Distribution Functions, Histograms, Box Plots, and Bee Swarm Plots
* Check for normality by overlaying the ECDF on the CDF of a normal distribution with the same mean and variance as the data

### Statistical Techniques
* Relate a scatter plot between two variables to their covariance and correlation coefficients
* Detect relationships amongst categorical, non-linearly related and non-normally distributed variables by computing Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient
* Conduct Pearson's Chi-Squared Test to test the null hypothesis that two variables are independent
* Approximate probabilities by conducting random trials

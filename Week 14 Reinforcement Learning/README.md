# Reinforcement Learning

## Local Machine Requirements
### [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* Download links: https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download
* Mac instructions: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/
* Windows instructions: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

## Notebook Rendering
The following notebooks contain animations for which the code must be re-run to display:

* [Cart-Pole](https://github.com/rayheberer/LambdaSchoolDataScience/blob/master/Week%2014%20Reinforcement%20Learning/Reinforcement%20Learning/Cart-Pole.ipynb)

## Learning Objectives

### Docker
* Use Docker to facilitate building and running containers with our code and dependencies
* Set up a local environment suitable for reinforcement learning (a full working setup of OpenAI Gym)

### Reinforcement Learning with OpenAI Gym
* Explain the mathematical fundamentals of reinforcement learning
* Implement RL agents on OpenAI Gym environments (Cart-Pole, Pong, Taxi)
* For discrete enviroenmtns, use Q-learning to learn a matrix populated with expected rewards 

### Object Detection
* Implement object detection and localization using pretrained CNNs and basic image manipulation
* Explain how real-world agents are enabled by advances in computer vision

## Learning Objectives

### High Dimensionality
* Normalize a vector and represent it by its magnitude and unit direction vector
* Compute L1 and L2 distances of a pair of vectors
* Compute the distance between pairs of vectors and select the smallest

### Dimensionality Reduction
* Identify the use case for data normalization/standardization
* Graph the top two principal components of a high dimensional dataset with PCA
* Compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a dataset's covariance matrix

# Mathematical Foundations

## Functions and Optima
* graph some of the typical shapes of 2D functions
* link a function with a table of values
* calculate the derivative of `f(x)`

## Linear Algebra
* create and edit a vector with numpy 
* add two vectors together
* subtract a vector from another vector
* calculate the magnitude of a vector in numpy
* multiply a matrix with a vector
* invert a matrix and describe what this does
* transpose a matrix

# Modeling

## Learning Objectives

### Linear Regression
* Describe Linear Regression: the simplest ML model
* Use gradient descent to compute the Linear Regression (LR) parameters
* Predict a vector v_i, given its x coordinate and a linear model relating x and y
* Use the matrix form to compute the LR parameters

### Logistic Regression
* Create a training set and train a Logistic Regression model with it
* Predict values for y using a test set
* Calculate sum-of-squared error SSE(y, yhat)
* Calculate the error rate of a model as a percentage

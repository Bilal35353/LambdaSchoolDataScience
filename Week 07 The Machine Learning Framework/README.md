## Kaggle InClass Competition
The assignment named "The Machine Learning Framework" was tied to a Kaggle InClass prediction competition. Instead of completing a code challenge on Day 3, students created Kaggle accounts and signed up for the competition.

## Learning Objectives

### Model Tuning
* Use cross_validation library to run many experiments
* Identify hyperparameters for tuning
* Disambiguate "parameters" and "hyperparameters"
* Use grid search to automatically explore some hyperparameters
* Manually select a test/train/validation set to run a single controlled experiment
* Compute AUC to validate a set of experimental result

### Supervised Learning
* Train SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and other models
* Adjust hyperparameters of supervised learning models
* Save model parameterization for use during productization
* Join Kaggle contests and submit results
